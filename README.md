# Predicting-30-Day-Hospital-Readmissions-Using-Machine-Learning-on-Clinical-and-Demographic-Data
This project develops a predictive model to identify patients at risk of 30-day hospital readmission using clinical and demographic data. Leveraging techniques like data preprocessing, feature engineering, recursive feature elimination (RFE), and supervised learning algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Neural Networks), the model aims to assist healthcare providers in making informed discharge decisions. The solution emphasizes interpretability, scalability, and real-world impact, offering insights to reduce avoidable readmissions and improve patient outcomes.
